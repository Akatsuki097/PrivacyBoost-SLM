It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(d): The physical exam suggests that this condition is present.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: man, comes, office, nonproductive cough, runny nose, frontal headache, headache, morning, nd, ibuprofen, relief, not, shortness of breath, Medical history, no medications, ibuprofen, pain, Vital signs, temperature, 37.4, \u00b0, 99.4, \u00b0, pulse, 88/min, 18/min, blood pressure, 120/84, Examination, nares, erythematous, mucous membranes, Examination, throat, erythema, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia, posterior oropharynx, no, cervical adenopathy, Lungs, clear, auscultation, patient's, symptoms\nAnswer Choice: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Sore throats are common symptoms in multiple upper respiratory viruses.\n(a): A non-productive cough is a common symptom in upper respiratory viruses but is not present in allergic rhinitis.
