        "Question": "In a pedigree of an autosomal dominant trait it is observed that:",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) The trait appears more frequently in males. (b) The unaffected people do not transmit the trait. (c) The trait tends to skip generations. (d) The affected people have both affected parents. (e) The trait tends to appear in the progeny of related parents.",
        "Explanation": "Let's think step by step. Autosomal dominant inheritance is a mode of genetic transmission in which a trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child. The autosomal dominant inheritance is not influenced by an individual's sex, which rules out (a). The affected allele is dominant and only one copy of the affected gene for trait expression This rules out (c), (d) and (e). Unaffected individuals do not have the mutated gene and cannot transmit the trait. Therefore the answer is (b)."

        "Question": "When caring for a patient who has undergone a supraglottic laryngectomy, you should bear in mind that:",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) He has lost the ability to speak by extirpation of the true vocal cords. (b) The tracheostomy they have performed will be permanent. (c) You have a risk of bronchoaspiration due to difficulty swallowing. (d) You may have constipation due to cervical dissection. (e) A portion of the larynx has been removed along with a vocal cord.",
        "Explanation": "Let's think step by step. A supraglottic laryngectomy, also known as a horizontal partial laryngectomy, is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the epiglottis, false vocal cords, and the upper half of the thyroid cartilage. This surgery significantly impacts the swallowing mechanism by taking away protective layers and sensation. As a result, there is an increased risk of bronchoaspiration. Therefore, the answer is (c)."

        "Question": "The eudismic index is a parameter with pharmacological interest that expresses the relationship between:",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) Two diastereomer drugs (b) Two bioisostero drugs (c) Two enantiomers (d) A drug and a prodrug, structural analog (e) Two structural modifications, one hydrophilic and one lipophilic, of a certain drug.",
        "Explanation": "Let's think step by step. The eudismic ratio represents the difference in pharmacologic activity between the two enantiomers of a drug. Therefore, the answer is (c)."

        "Question": "As is known, estrogenic treatment can give rise to various adverse effects. Which of the following is NOT an adverse effect due to this pharmacological action?",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) Edema  (b) Breast pain  (c) Ovarian cancer (d) Sickness (e) Headaches",
        "Explanation": "Let\u2019s think step by step. Estrogen therapy involves supplementing a patient with estrogen, the primary female sex hormone. Potential side effects include breast tenderness or swelling, edema, nausea, leg cramps, endometrial cancer, and more. Ovarian cancer is not known to be an adverse effect of estrogenic treatment. Therefore, the answer is (c)."

        "Question": "In choosing the type of cardiac valvular prosthesis (biological or mechanical) to be implanted in a patient,  various aspects and characteristics of the patient and the prosthesis must be considered. In view of the aforementioned, point out the INCORRECT statement:",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) Permanent anticoagulation is necessary in mechanical prostheses. (b) In general, biological prostheses are indicated in young patients, with long life expectancy. (c) Biological prostheses would be indicated in cases that present a formal contraindication for anticoagulation. (d) The rate of structural deterioration of a biological prosthesis is inversely proportional to the age of the subject. (e) Biological prostheses do not require permanent anticoagulation.",
        "Explanation": " Let\u2019s think step by step. Cardiac valvular prostheses (biological or mechanical) are artificial cardiac valves implanted into a patient's heart. The latest revisions of the ESC/EACTS guidelines suggest that bioprostheses are acceptable in patients aged between 60 and 65 years at the time of surgery. A reoperation suggests that the implanted cartifical valve does not work properly. The reoperation rate for structural valve degeneration (SVD) of bioprostheses occurred exclusively among patients younger than 56 years, suggesting that biological prostheses are not suitable for younger patients. Therefore, the answer is (b)."
