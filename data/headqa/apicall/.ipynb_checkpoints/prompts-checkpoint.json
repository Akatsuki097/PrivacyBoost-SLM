    "Context": "Question Keywords: autosomal dominant trait\nAnswer Choice: (a) The trait appears more frequently in males. (b) The unaffected people do not transmit the trait. (c) The trait tends to skip generations. (d) The affected people have both affected parents. (e) The trait tends to appear in the progeny of related parents.\nContext: Autosomal dominant inheritance is a mode of genetic transmission in which a trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child. One copy of a mutated gene from one parent can cause the genetic condition. For example, let \u2018A\u2019 represent the affected allele and \u2018a\u2019 represent the unaffected allele. An affected person may have the genotype AA or Aa, while an unaffected person has the genotype aa. Consequently, an individual with genotype AA has a 100% chance of passing on the affected allele, and someone with genotype Aa has a 50% chance of doing so.\n(a): Autosomal dominant inheritance is not influenced by an individual's sex, as it is not sex-dependent. The expression of the trait occurs regardless of gender. It is not a characteristic of autosomal dominant inheritance.\n(b): Unaffected individuals do not have the mutated gene and therefore cannot transmit the trait. \n(c): Autosomal dominant traits can be passed down through multiple generations. Since the affected allele is dominant, an individual will express the trait as long as they inherit the affected gene. It is not a characteristic of autosomal dominant inheritance.\n(d): Only one affected parent is needed to transmit on the autosomal dominant trait to their child. It is not a characteristic of autosomal dominant inheritance.\n(e): A dominant gene can appear in any progeny, regardless of the parent.It is not a characteristic of autosomal dominant inheritance.\nTherefore, the answer is (b).\n\nQuestion Keywords: caring, patient, supraglottic laryngectomy\nAnswer Choice: (a) He has lost the ability to speak by extirpation of the true vocal cords. (b) The tracheostomy they have performed will be permanent. (c) You have a risk of bronchoaspiration due to difficulty swallowing. (d) You may have constipation due to cervical dissection. (e) A portion of the larynx has been removed along with a vocal cord.\nContext: Supraglottic laryngectomy or horizontal partial laryngectomy is an operation to remove the epiglottis, false vocal cords, and superior half of the thyroid cartilage.\n(a): Supraglottic laryngectomy removes the false vocal cords, but the true vocal cords are not affected, and the patient's ability to speak should not be significantly impacted. It is not typical to lose the ability to speak by extirpation of the true vocal cords.\n(b): If a tracheostomy tube is in place after the procedure, it is typically removed within 24-48 hours of surgery. It is not typical to involve A permanent tracheostomy as a part of the supraglottic laryngectomy process.\n(c): Supraglottic laryngectomy results in severe disturbance to the swallowing mechanism by removal of protective layers and sensation. There is an increased risk of bronchoaspiration.\n(d): Constipation is not a side effect of supraglottic laryngectomy. It is not related to care of patients with supraglottic laryngectomy.\n(e): Supraglottic laryngectomy is an operation to remove the epiglottis, false vocal cords, and superior half of the thyroid cartilage. In this procedure, the true vocal cords are not typically affected, preserving the patient's ability to speak as much as possible. It is not common to remove a portion of the larynx along with a true vocal cord during this procedure.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: estrogenic treatment, adverse effects, NOT, adverse effect, pharmacological action\nAnswer Choice:  (a) Edema (b) Breast pain  (c) Ovarian cancer (d) Sickness (e) Headaches\nContext: Estrogen therapy involves supplementing a patient with estrogen, the primary female sex hormone. Potential side effects include breast tenderness or swelling, edema, nausea, leg cramps, endometrial cancer, and more.\n(a): Edema is a potential adverse effect of estrogen therapy. Estrogen and aldosterone both originate from cholesterol, and an excessive amount of estrogen in the body can stimulate aldosterone receptors, leading to water retention in nephrons. This water retention can result in edema. It is a non-adverse effect.\n(b): Estrogen promotes ductal growth and fat deposition in the breasts. Excessive estrogen levels can lead to mammary duct hyperplasia, which may result in breast pain. It is not a non-adverse effect.\n(c): Ovarian cancer is not known to be an adverse effect of estrogenic treatment.\n(d): Edema is a possible adverse effect of estrogenic treatment, and swelling in body parts may cause the feeling of sickness. It is not a non-adverse effect.\n(e): Headache is a possible adverse effect of estrogenic treatment. It is not a non-adverse effect.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: cardiac valvular prosthesis, biological, mechanical, implanted, patient, aspects, characteristics, patient, prosthesis, INCORRECT, statement\nAnswer Choice: (a) Permanent anticoagulation is necessary in mechanical prostheses. (b) In general, biological prostheses are indicated in young patients, with long life expectancy. (c) Biological prostheses would be indicated in cases that present a formal contraindication for anticoagulation. (d) The rate of structural deterioration of a biological prosthesis is inversely proportional to the age of the subject. (e) Biological prostheses do not require permanent anticoagulation.\nContext: Cardiac valvular prostheses (biological or mechanical) are artificial cardiac valves implanted into a patient's heart. Mechanical valves may last a lifetime, but they come with an increased risk of blood clots, necessitating the use of blood thinners such as warfarin. In contrast, biological valves, which are made from pig or cow tissue, do not increase the risk of bleeding or clotting but tend to wear out sooner.\n(a): Mechanical valves increase the risk of blood clotting. It is not an incorrect statement.\n(b): The latest revisions of the ESC/EACTS guidelines suggest that bioprostheses are acceptable in patients aged between 60 and 65 years at the time of surgery. The reoperation rate for structural valve degeneration (SVD) of bioprostheses occurred exclusively among patients younger than 56 years. Young patients are not typically recommended for a biological prosthesis.\n(c): Biological prostheses, which are made from pig or cow tissue, do not increase the risk of either bleeding or clotting but will wear out sooner. It is not an incorrect statement.\n(d): The disadvantages of biological heart valves are a smaller valve orifice area and the risk of structural valve degeneration, which may necessitate reoperation. Thus, the younger the patient, the higher risk of structural deterioration. It is not an incorrect statement.\n(e): Biological prosthesis do not increase the risk of clotting so do not require permanent anticoagulant. It is not an incorrect statement.\nTherefore, the answer is (b).\n\nQuestion Keywords: connection, automatic, emotional responses, control, behaviors, guiding, behavior, manifestation, emotional responses\nAnswer Choice: (a) The angular gyrus of the limbic system. (b) The convolution or lobe of the insula. (c) The prefrontal orbitofrontal or ventromedial cortex. (d) The thalamus (e) The cortex of somatosensory association.\nContext: The prefrontal orbitofrontal cortex has multiple functions including mediating context specific responding, encoding contingencies in a flexible manner, encoding value, encoding inferred value, inhibiting responses, learning changes in contingency, emotional appraisal, altering behavior through somatic markers, driving social behavior, and representing state spaces. The orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the reward value of the goals for action.\n(a): The angular gyrus (AG) is a hub of several networks that are involved in various functions, including attention, self-processing, semantic information processing, emotion regulation, and mentalizing. It is not the area responsible for connecting automatic emotional responses and controlling complex behaviors.\n(b): The insula is important for gustatory and sensorimotor processing, risk-reward behavior, autonomics, pain pathways, and auditory and vestibular functioning. It is not the area responsible for connecting automatic emotional responses and controlling complex behaviors.\n(c): The prefrontal cortex guides behavior by controlling the manifestation of emotional responses through understanding rewards, encoding values, and driving behaviors.\n(d): The thalamus acts as the body's information relay station. All sensory information (except for olfaction) must be processed through the thalamus before being sent to the cerebral cortex for interpretation. It is not the area responsible for connecting automatic emotional responses and controlling complex behaviors.\n(e): The somatosensory cortex is responsible for processing all bodily sensations. These sensations originate from receptors located throughout the body that detect temperature, pain, touch, pressure, and proprioception. It is not the area responsible for connecting automatic emotional responses and controlling complex behaviors.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\n"
