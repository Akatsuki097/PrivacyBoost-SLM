ADH acts on the kidneys to increase water reabsorption, which helps to decrease plasma osmolarity. Auricular natriuretic factor (FNA) is a hormone that is secreted by the heart in response to increased blood volume and pressure. It promotes the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, which helps to decrease plasma volume and osmolarity. Aldosterone is a hormone that is secreted by the adrenal glands in response to low blood pressure or low blood volume. It acts on the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium, which helps to increase blood volume and pressure. Angiotensin is a hormone that is produced by the liver and lungs in response to low blood pressure or low blood volume.

She also received treatment for osteoporosis with denosumab 60 mg every 6 months. During a consultation at the clinic after 4 months, the patient reported a general syndrome of fever and continuous pain in the right lumbar fossa. Upon examination, a positive renal fist was found. An analytical sample showed leukocytes at 14,000/mm3 with left deviation. Hb was 9 g/dL, and VSG was 82 mm/hour. The urinary sediment showed leukocyturia, and urine cytology showed abundant macrophages with a foamy appearance. The diagnosis is likely to be (b) Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.\nExplanation: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare, chronic, and severe renal infection that is characterized by the destruction of renal parenchyma and the formation of abscesses. It is typically caused by bacterial infections, and the most common causative agent is Escherichia coli. Patients with XGP often present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, and flank pain. The diagnosis of XGP is based on clinical, radiological, and pathological findings. In this case, the patient's symptoms, positive renal fist, and urinary sediment findings suggest a diagnosis of XGP. Renal tuberculosis (a) is a chronic granulomatous disease that typically presents with constitutional symptoms, hematuria, and sterile pyuria. Kidney abscess (c) is a rare condition that is typically caused by bacterial infections and presents with fever, flank pain, and leukocytosis. Renal adenocarcinoma (d) is a malignant tumor of the kidney that typically presents with hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable mass",
