        "overall": "Patricia Benner is a nursing theorist who developed a model for the stages of nursing practice. According to Benner, there are five levels of nursing practice: beginner, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. The beginner nurse has no experience and relies on rules to guide their practice. The advanced beginner has some experience and can recognize recurring patterns. The competent nurse has gained enough experience to be able to plan and organize care. The proficient nurse has developed a holistic understanding of patient care and can prioritize interventions. The expert nurse has an intuitive grasp of situations and can quickly identify and respond to patient needs. It is not a characteristic of the nursing theory of Dorothea Orem, Callista Roy, or Kari Martinsen",
