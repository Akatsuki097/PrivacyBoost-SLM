Theories of aging, such as the activity theory, suggest that remaining active and engaged in social roles is important for successful aging. However, it is not necessary to acquire new roles in old age to achieve well-being. It is also not necessary to carry out a certain number of activities to age successfully. While it may be necessary to voluntarily abandon certain activities as physical and cognitive abilities decline, aging in a healthy way does not necessarily imply not dissociating from social roles. The level of activity in old age is influenced by a variety of factors, including life trajectory, but it is not the only factor that determines successful aging.",
