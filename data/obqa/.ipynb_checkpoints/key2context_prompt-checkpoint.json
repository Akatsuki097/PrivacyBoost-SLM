    "Context": "Question Keywords: acid, environment, aquatic, rain, effect, acid rain\nAnswer Choice: (a) decrease in plant life (b) increase in fish population (c) increase in plant growth (d) cleaner and clearer water\nContext: The acid rain is a type of rain that has an acidic effect due to the presence of acid in the atmosphere. Acid rain is harmful to the environment, especially aquatic life. The acid in the rain can have a negative effect on the water quality of aquatic environments.\n(a): Acid rain can have a negative effect on plant life. The acid in the rain can damage plant cells and cause a decrease in plant growth, leading to a decrease in plant life. \n(b): Acid rain can have a harmful effect on aquatic life, including fish. The acid in the water can make it difficult for fish to breathe and can harm their reproductive systems. It is not likely to have an increase in fish population by acid rain.\n(c): As previously mentioned, the acid in the rain can damage plant cells and cause a decrease in plant growth. It is not possible to have an increase in plant growth.\n(d): Acid rain can have a harmful effect on water quality, making it more acidic and harmful to aquatic life. It is not possible to have  cleaner and clearer water.\nTherefore, the answer is (a).\n\nQuestion Keywords: moon, surface\nAnswer Choice: (a) is smooth on the entire surface (b) contains large cavities cause by explosions (c) contains an internal core of cheese (d) is filled with lakes\nContext: The moon is a natural satellite that orbits around the Earth. Its surface is covered with dead volcanoes, impact craters, and lava flows, some visible to the unaided stargazer.\n(a): The moon has mountains, craters, and other features caused by impacts from meteoroids and asteroids. It is not entirely smooth on the surface.\n(b): Impact craters are formed when an asteroid craters, each of which was formed when an asteroid or comet collided with the Moon's surface.  The moon's surface contains large cavities caused by explosions from impacts.\n(c): The core is largely composed of iron and some nickel. The inner core is a solid mass about 480 km in diameter. It does not contain an internal core of cheese.\n(d): The moon has lunar maria composed of basalt formed from surface lava flows that later congealed. It is not filled with lakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (b).\n\nQuestion Keywords: car, approach, night\nAnswer Choice: (a) the headlights become more intense (b) the headlights recede into the dark (c) the headlights remain at a constant (d) the headlights turn off\nContext: Headlights of a car are a source of light. As a car approaches, the source of light becomes closer, and that source will appear brighter.\n(a): As the car becomes closer, the distance to the source of light decreases. The headlights become brighter and more intense.\n(b): If the source does not change and the headlights are closer, the headlights cannot become dimmer. This is not a commonsense relation.\n(c): If the distance to the source of light changes, the brightness of headlights will change. It is not able to remain constant.\n(d): Turning off the headlights would cause the driver to be driving in complete darkness, which is dangerous and can lead to accidents. Iis not a reasonable condition.\nTherefore, the answer is (a).\n\nQuestion Keywords: change, easter, weather change, weather, christmas\nAnswer Choice: (a) the air may chill (b) the ground may freeze (c) the plants may die (d) the ground may warm\nContext: In the US, Christmas falls in the winter season, while Easter arrives at the beginning of spring.\n(a): The air becomes chill as temperature drops. The temperature commonly  increases from winter to spring. It is not a likely scenario.\n(b): During winter, the ground usually freezes, whereas in spring, it does not.  It is not a probable scenario.\n(c): Extreme cold or hot weather can cause plants to die. The beginning of spring provides suitable weather conditions for plants to grow. It is not common to have plants die.\n(d): As winter transitions into spring, the weather becomes warmer. The temperature of the ground is influenced by the weather.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: heat, recipe, moisture, good, ocean\nAnswer Choice: (a) a violent storm (b) violent sea animals (c) condensation (d) inland storms\nContext: The ocean, a vast body of water that covers a large portion of the Earth's surface, serves as a source of heat and moisture.\n(a): The heat and moisture present in the ocean can create ideal conditions for a hurricane or typhoon, both of which are violent storms.\n(b): Violent sea animals are not related to heat and moisture in the ocean.\n(c): Condensation is the process by which water vapor becomes liquid, which is the reverse of evaporation. This can happen in one of two ways: either the air is cooled to its dew point or it becomes so saturated with water vapor that it cannot hold any more water. It is not likely to occur in hot conditions.\n(d): Although heat and moisture can cause inland storms, they are not directly related to the ocean. It is not a likely choice.\nTherefore, the answer is (a).\n\nQuestion Keywords: hummingbird, take\nAnswer Choice: (a) bees (b) energy (c) pollen (d) honey\nContext: Hummingbirds dip their long bills into flowers to drink nectar to get energy.\n(a): Hummingbirds and bees are both attracted to the sweet nectar produced by flowers, but bees extract the nectar from the base of the flowers, while hummingbirds dip their long bills into the flowers to drink the nectar and obtain energy.\n(b): Hummingbirds obtain energy by getting nectar from flowers through dipping their long bills into the flowers.\n(c): When hummingbirds drink nectar, they also inadvertently take grains of pollen which stick to their feathers and bills, and get carried to the next flower they visit.\n(d): Hummingbirds do not produce or consume honey. This fact is unrelated to their method of obtaining energy by drinking nectar from flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: responsible, sun\nAnswer Choice: (a) puppies learning new tricks (b) children growing up and getting old (c) flowers wilting in a vase (d) plants sprouting, blooming and wilting\nContext: The sun is the source of energy for physical cycles on Earth.\n(a): Puppies learning new tricks involves the acquisition and processing of information, which is essential for the puppies to learn and adapt to their environment. It is not directly related to the effect of the sun.\n(b): Children grow up and age over time. The sun is not directly responsible for the passage of time itself. It is not directly related to the effect of the sun.\n(c): Flowers in a vase become wilting because they are cut from their original source of nutrients and water and are no longer able to receive the essential nourishment they need to stay healthy and vibrant. It is not directly related to the effect of the sun.\n(d): Plants need sunlight to photosynthesize and grow, and the sun's heat and light play a crucial role in the process of plant growth and decay.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\n"
