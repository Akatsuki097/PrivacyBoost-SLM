The trial involved 400 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either pulmharkimab 75 mg/day or a placebo for 12 months.

However, it was associated with a two-fold risk increase for cardiovascular disease even after adjusting for comorbidities. The error noticed in the summary is that the pulmharkimab dosage mentioned is 75 mg/day, which is generally lower than the standard dosage of 150 mg/day used in other studies.
