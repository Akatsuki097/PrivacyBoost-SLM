    "Context": "Question Keywords: office, ribs 4-5\nAnswer Choice: (a) anterior scalene (b) latissimus dorsi (c) pectoralis minor (d) quadratus lumborum\nContext: Muscles are attached to ribs in various locations, and these attachments can lead to exertional pain in specific areas of the ribcage.\n(a) Anterior scalene attaches to the first rib. It is not responsible for exertional pain in ribs 4-5.\n(b) Latissimus dorsi connects to ribs 9 and 10.  It is not involved in exertional pain in ribs 4-5.\n(c) Pectoralis minor attaches to ribs 3, 4, and 5. Issues with the pectoralis minor muscle can cause exertional pain around ribs 3-5, due to its connection to these ribs. It is a muscle likely to cause pain in ribs 4-5.\n(d) Quadratus lumborum connects to ribs 11 and 12. It is not responsible for exertional pain in ribs 4-5.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: trauma, truck, day, posterior inferior lateral angle, right\nAnswer Choice: (a) left-on-left sacral torsion (b) left-on-right sacral torsion (c) right unilateral sacral flexion (d) right-on-right sacral torsion\nContext: Sacral torsions could be observed based on a physical examination by identifying specific signs and symptoms. This examination shows the presence of a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. It is not consistent with the posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is consistent with the posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. It is consistent with the posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\nTherefore, the answer is (c) or (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: :man, frontal headache,shortness of breath, Medical history, \u00b0, 120/84, mucous membranes, posterior oropharynx, symptoms\nAnswer Choice: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Frontal headache can be a symptom of a viral upper respiratory infection. Shortness of breath may be indicative of infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.  Nasal mucous membranes serve as a crucial part of the immune system, helping to keep harmful germs out of the body. An oropharyngeal examination can reveal abnormalities in the mucosa or tonsils.  Based on the provided symptoms, it is difficult to definitively diagnose the patient's condition.\n(a): Allergic rhinitis can cause sneezing, congestion, and an itchy, runny nose. In some cases, allergies or sinus issues may lead to headaches.\n(b): Swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, fatigue, and headache are some of the symptoms of mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.\n(c): Shortness of breath can be a symptom of infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n(d): Rhinovirus can cause a frontal headache. Rhinovirus (HRV) infection is a significant trigger of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a severe lung disease that progressively makes it difficult to breathe.\nTherefore, the answer is none.\n\nQuestion Keywords: healthy, months, car crash, decreased, states, sad, five, perfectionist, urges, neurotransmitters\nAnswer Choice: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: Each of the answer choices corresponds to a specific neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals within the nervous system and between neurons.\n(a): Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that increases positive emotions. It is implicated in many disease processes, including Parkinson's and ADHD, and is targeted by antipsychotic medications.\n(b): Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is associated with multiple neurological disorders including epilepsy, stroke, and autism. It is not related to sadness.\n(c): Norepinephrine is a catecholamine with adrenergic properties. It is not related to sadness.\n(d): Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which is the target for multiple antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics, which would address depression.\nTherefore, the answer is (a) or (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: preoperative, One, blood pressure, incidental, complete blood count, elevated blood pressure, disclosed, urinary normetanephrine, 36.6, 100/min, treatment\nAnswer Choice: (a) Labetalol (b) A loading dose of potassium chloride (c) Nifedipine (d) Phenoxybenzamine\nContext: The patient has a preoperative evaluation with evaluated blood pressure.Urine metanephrines testing is used to help detect or rule out the presence of a rare tumor called a pheochromocytoma or a paraganglioma that releases excess metanephrines.\n(a): Labetalol is a  beta-blocker that works by blocking the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones on the heart and blood vessels. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(b): The use of a potassium chloride loading dose is a treatment specifically for hypokalemia, which is a condition where there are abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood. It  is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(c): This drug is commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and angina. It can also help relieve symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(d): This medication is used as a preoperative preparation treatment to block alpha-adrenergic receptors in the body and it effectively treats hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\n"
