It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(b): The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches to ribs 9 and 10. It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(c): The pectoralis minor muscle is attached to ribs 3, 4, and 5. Dysfunction in the fourth and fifth ribs can be caused by issues with the pectoralis minor muscle due to its attachment to these ribs. It is associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(d): Quadratus lumborum muscle attaches to ribs 11 and 12. It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: male, office, low back pain, denies, any, trauma, says, truck, day, job, Examination, patient, prone position, deep sacral, left, posterior inferior lateral angle, right, lumbosacral junction, springs, freely, compression, diagnosis\nCandidate Answers: (a) left-on-left sacral torsion (b) left-on-right sacral torsion (c) right unilateral sacral flexion (d) right-on-right sacral torsion\nContext: The physical exam shows the deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. It is consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: man, comes, office, nonproductive cough, runny nose, frontal headache, headache, morning, nd, ibuprofen, relief, not, shortness of breath, Medical history, no medications, ibuprofen, pain, Vital signs, temperature, 37.4, \u00b0, 99.4, \u00b0, pulse, 88/min, 18/min, blood pressure, 120/84, Examination, nares, erythematous, mucous membranes, Examination, throat, erythema, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia, posterior oropharynx, no, cervical adenopathy, Lungs, clear, auscultation, patient's, symptoms\nCandidate Answers: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Sore throats are common symptoms in multiple upper respiratory viruses.\n(a): A non-productive cough is a common symptom in upper respiratory viruses but is not present in allergic rhinitis. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(b): The absence of shortness of breath indicates mycoplasma is less probable. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(c): Cervical adenopathy is commonly seen in cases of Epstein Barr virus. The absence of cervical adenopathy indicates Epstein Barr virus is less likely. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(d): Rhinovirus can cause this patient\u2019s symptoms, including sore throat, runny nose and a frontal headache. It is the cause of the symptoms.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: healthy, woman, comes, physician, 8, months, husband, killed, car crash, decreased, difficulty falling asleep, states, sad, cries, frequently, door lock, five, house, five, pieces, toilet paper, perfectionist, urges, rituals, Pharmacotherapy, neurotransmitters\nCandidate Answers: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: The woman is exhibiting symptoms of major depressive episodes, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent crying, and a persistent feeling of sadness.\n(a): Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that increases positive emotions. It is implicated in many disease processes, including Parkinson's and ADHD, and is targeted by antipsychotic medications but not used as a sleep aid.
