    "Context": "Question Keywords: male, marathon runner, office, complaint, right-sided rib pain, Physical examination, normal heart, lung findings, dysfunction, right, muscles, muscle groups, dysfunction\nCandidate Answers: (a) anterior scalene (b) latissimus dorsi (c) pectoralis minor (d) quadratus lumborum\nContext: The marathon runner with normal heart and lung findings in physical examination and complaint with right-sided rib pain suggest a musculoskeletal cause of exertional chest pain.\n(a): The anterior scalene muscle attaches to the first rib. It is a possible muscle to cause right-sided rib pain.\n(b): The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches to ribs 9 and 10. It is a possible muscle to cause right-sided rib pain.\n(c): Pectoralis minor: The pectoralis minor muscle is attached to ribs 3, 4, and 5. It is a possible muscle to cause right-sided rib pain.\n(d): Quadratus lumborum muscle attaches to ribs 11 and 12. It is a possible muscle to cause right-sided rib pain.\nTherefore, the answer is none.\n\nQuestion Keywords: office, denies, any, says, truck, job, Examination, patient, prone position, deep sacral, left, posterior inferior lateral angle, lumbosacral junction, springs, freely, compression, diagnosis\nCandidate Answers: (a) left-on-left sacral torsion (b) left-on-right sacral torsion (c) right unilateral sacral flexion (d) right-on-right sacral torsion\nContext: Sacral torsions can be identified through physical examination. The physical exam shows the deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle without a specific side and normal spring test.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is not consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. It is consistent with the findings from the physical exam.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: comes, office, nonproductive cough, frontal headache, headache, morning, nd, ibuprofen, relief, Medical history, no medications,  ibuprofen, pain, Vital signs, \u00b0, 99.4, \u00b0, pulse, 88/min, 18/min, Examination, nares, Examination, throat, erythema, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia,  posterior oropharynx, no, cervical adenopathy, Lungs, clear, auscultation, patient's\nCandidate Answers: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Nonproductive cough, frontal headache and normal vital signs could suggest different  multiple upper respiratory viruses.\n(a): A non-productive cough is a common symptom in upper respiratory viruses but is not present in allergic rhinitis. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(b): Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria commonly cause mild infections of the respiratory system (the parts of the body involved in breathing). Sometimes these bacteria can cause more serious lung infections that require care in a hospital. It is not consistent with the clear lung on auscultation.\n(c): Cervical adenopathy is commonly seen in cases of Epstein Barr virus. The absence of cervical adenopathy indicates Epstein Barr virus is less likely. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(d): Rhinovirus can cause this patient\u2019s symptoms, including nonproductive cough and frontal headache. It also causes follicular lymphoid hyperplasia. It could be the cause of the symptoms.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: healthy, comes, physician, 8, months, husband, killed, car crash, decreased,  difficulty falling asleep, states, sad, cries, frequently, door lock, five, house, five, toilet paper,  perfectionist, urges, rituals, neurotransmitters\nCandidate Answers: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: Difficulty falling asleep, sadness and frequent crying are symptoms of major depressive episodes.\n(a): Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that increases positive emotions. It is implicated in many disease processes, including Parkinson's and ADHD, and is targeted by antipsychotic medications but not used as a sleep aid. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(b): Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is associated with multiple neurological disorders including epilepsy, stroke, and autism. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(c): Norepinephrine is a catecholamine with adrenergic properties. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(d): Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which is the target for multiple antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics. It would address the patient's symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: office, preoperative, evaluation, adrenalectomy, 2, weeks, One, month, care, emergency department, pain,  right flank, motor vehicle collision, 160/100, laboratory studies, complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, liver function tests,  patient, healthy, elevated blood pressure, no medications, office 2, disclosed, elevated, urinary normetanephrine, metanephrine, plasma, concentrations,  patient, surgeon, recommended, vital signs, temperature, 36.6, 97.9, pulse, 100/min, 14/min, blood pressure, 170/95, Physical examination, no significant, findings, preparation, treatment\nCandidate Answers: (a) Labetalol (b) A loading dose of potassium chloride (c) Nifedipine (d) Phenoxybenzamine\nContext: The patient is being evaluated for adrenalectomy. The elevated blood pressure and elevated, urinary normetanephrine shows the possibility of a pheochromocytoma.\n(a): This beta-blocker works by blocking the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones on the heart and blood vessels. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(b): The use of a potassium chloride loading dose is a treatment specifically for hypokalemia, which is a condition where there are abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(c): This drug is commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and angina. It can also help relieve symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(d): This medication is used as a preoperative preparation treatment to block alpha-adrenergic receptors in the body and it effectively treats hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. It is a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\n"
