    "Context": "Question Keywords: male, marathon runner, complaint, normal heart, ribs 4-5, right, muscles, dysfunction\nCandidate Answers: (a) anterior scalene (b) latissimus dorsi (c) pectoralis minor (d) quadratus lumborum\nContext: A marathon runner with a normal heart has muscle dysfunction located in ribs 4-5 on the right side. The individual requires treatment targeting specific muscle groups.\n(a) Anterior scalene attaches to the first rib. It is not associated with location in ribs 4-5.\n(b) Latissimus dorsi connects to ribs 9 and 10. It is not associated with location in ribs 4-5.\n(c): The pectoralis minor muscle is attached to ribs 3, 4, and 5. Dysfunction in the fourth and fifth ribs can be caused by issues with the pectoralis minor muscle due to its attachment to these ribs. It is a muscle likely to cause pain in ribs 4-5.\n(d) Quadratus lumborum connects to ribs 11 and 12. It is not associated with location in ribs 4-5.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Keywords: low back pain, trauma, says, deep sacral, left, posterior inferior lateral angle, right, compression, diagnosis\nCandidate Answers: (a) left-on-left sacral torsion (b) left-on-right sacral torsion (c) right unilateral sacral flexion (d) right-on-right sacral torsion\nContext: Sacral torsions can be identified through physical examination. The patient in question has a deep sacral sulcus on the left and a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. It is not consistent with the examination results.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the examination results.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is not consistent with the examination results.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. It is consistent with the patient's condition.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: :man, comes, nonproductive cough, runny nose, morning, no medications, ibuprofen, pain, Vital signs, 37.4, pulse, 88/min, 18/min,  blood pressure, Examination, nares, erythematous, mucous membranes, Lungs, clear, auscultation, patient's\nCandidate Answers: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: The patient has  nonproductive cough, runny nose, and erythematous, which may suggest hypersensitivity or acute infection.\n(a): A non-productive cough is a common symptom in upper respiratory viruses but is not present in allergic rhinitis. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(b): Swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, fatigue, and headache are some of the symptoms of mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is a possible cause.\n(c): Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria commonly cause mild infections of the respiratory system (the parts of the body involved in breathing). Sometimes these bacteria can cause more serious lung infections that require care in a hospital. It is not consistent with the clear lung on auscultation.\n(d): HRV infections can cause all the characteristic cold symptoms we experience, such as a runny nose, sore throat, headache, cough, and occasionally muscle aches and weakness, a mild fever, and ear/sinus infections. It is a possible cause.\nTherefore, the answer is (b) or (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: healthy, woman, comes, physician, 8, husband, difficulty falling asleep, states, sad, frequently, five, five, toilet paper, perfectionist, urges, rituals, neurotransmitters\nCandidate Answers: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: The woman is exhibiting symptoms of depression including difficulty falling asleep and sadness.\n(a): Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that increases positive emotions. It is implicated in many disease processes, including Parkinson's and ADHD, and is targeted by antipsychotic medications but not used as a sleep aid. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(b): Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is associated with multiple neurological disorders including epilepsy, stroke, and autism. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(c): Norepinephrine is a catecholamine with adrenergic properties. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(d): Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which is the target for multiple antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics, which would address the patient's symptoms of depression and anxiety. It also promotes better sleep health. It is a treatment for a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: man, adrenalectomy, scheduled, weeks, One, month, care, left adrenal mass, laboratory studies, liver function tests, patient, healthy, office 2, metanephrine, concentrations, patient, surgeon, recommended, adrenalectomy, 36.6, 97.9, pulse, 14/min, blood pressure, findings, preoperative, preparation, treatment\nCandidate Answers: (a) Labetalol (b) A loading dose of potassium chloride (c) Nifedipine (d) Phenoxybenzamine\nContext: The patient is being evaluated for adrenalectomy due to a left adrenal mass.Biochemical workup for the adrenal mass was significant for catecholamines and metanephrines, which are secreted by the neuroendocrine tumor pheochromocytoma. Symptoms of this disease include hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis.\n(a): Labetalol is a  beta-blocker that works by blocking the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones on the heart and blood vessels. It  is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(b): The use of a potassium chloride loading dose is a treatment specifically for hypokalemia, which is a condition where there are abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood. It  is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(c): This drug is commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and angina. It can also help relieve symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(d): This medication is used as a preoperative preparation treatment to block alpha-adrenergic receptors in the body and it effectively treats hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. It is a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\n"
