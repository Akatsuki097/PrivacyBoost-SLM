    "Context": "Question Random Span: distances. Physical examination reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5 on the right. Which of the following muscles\nCandidate Answers: (a) anterior scalene (b) latissimus dorsi (c) pectoralis minor (d) quadratus lumborum\nContext: Muscles are attached to ribs in various locations, and these attachments can lead to exertional pain in specific areas of the ribcage. Normal heart and lung findings on a physical exam coupled with evidence of exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5 on the right suggest a musculoskeletal cause of exertional chest pain.\n(a): The anterior scalene muscle attaches to the first rib. It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(b): The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches to ribs 9 and 10. It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(c): The pectoralis minor muscle is attached to ribs 3, 4, and 5. Dysfunction in the fourth and fifth ribs can be caused by issues with the pectoralis minor muscle due to its attachment to these ribs. It is associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(d): Quadratus lumborum muscle attaches to ribs 11 and 12. It is not associated with exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nQuestion Random Span: history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the\nCandidate Answers: (a) left-on-left sacral torsion (b) left-on-right sacral torsion (c) right unilateral sacral flexion (d) right-on-right sacral torsion\nContext: Low back pain presents the chief complaint, which is usually chronic in nature.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. No relationship can be found.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. No relationship can be found.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. No relationship can be found.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. No relationship can be found.\nTherefore, the answer is none.\n\nQuestion Random Span: 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg.  Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx.  There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is\nCandidate Answers: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Normal vital signs and erythematosus may suggest hypersensitivity or acute infection.\n(a): allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. It could be the cause of the symptoms.\n(b): Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria commonly cause mild infections of the respiratory system (the parts of the body involved in breathing). Sometimes these bacteria can cause more serious lung infections that require care in a hospital. It is not consistent with the clear lung on auscultation.\n(c): Cervical adenopathy is commonly seen in cases of Epstein Barr virus. The absence of cervical adenopathy indicates Epstein Barr virus is less likely. It is not the cause of the symptoms.\n(d): Symptoms of the common cold caused by the rhinovirus include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, headaches, and body aches. It could be the cause of the symptoms.\nTherefore, the answer is (a) or (d).\n\nQuestion Random Span: had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet\nCandidate Answers: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: The woman is exhibiting symptoms of major depressive episodes, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent crying, and a persistent feeling of sadness.\n(a): Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that increases positive emotions. It is implicated in many disease processes, including Parkinson's and ADHD, and is targeted by antipsychotic medications but not used as a sleep aid. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(b): Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is associated with multiple neurological disorders including epilepsy, stroke, and autism. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(c): Norepinephrine is a catecholamine with adrenergic properties. It is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms.\n(d): Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which is the target for multiple antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics. It could address the patient's symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\nQuestion Random Span: had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications.  A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations.  The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and  blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative\nCandidate Answers: (a) Labetalol (b) A loading dose of potassium chloride (c) Nifedipine (d) Phenoxybenzamine\nContext: The patient is being evaluated for adrenalectomy, which is likely causing elevated blood pressure as a symptom of pheochromocytoma. Elevated urinary normetanephrines confirm the diagnosis.\n(a): This beta-blocker works by blocking the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones on the heart and blood vessels. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(b): The use of a potassium chloride loading dose is a treatment specifically for hypokalemia, which is a condition where there are abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(c): This drug is commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and angina. It can also help relieve symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. It is not a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\n(d): This medication is used as a preoperative preparation treatment to block alpha-adrenergic receptors in the body and it effectively treats hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. It is a treatment for pheochromocytoma.\nTherefore, the answer is (d).\n\n"
