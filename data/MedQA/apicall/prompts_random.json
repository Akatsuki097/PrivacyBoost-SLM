During the evaluation, the clinician will assess the deep sacral sulcus, posterior inferior lateral angle, and lumbosacral mobility to determine the presence of any abnormalities. The patient shows lumbosacral mobility freely.\n(a): This condition is characterized by the deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left and normal spring test. It is consistent with the lumbosacral mobility freely.\n(b): The left-on-right sacral torsion would be indicated by a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the left, and a positive spring test. It is not consistent with the lumbosacral mobility freely.\n(c): This condition is characterized by a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, a deep sacral sulcus on the right, and an absence of normal spring test. It is consistent with the lumbosacral mobility freely.\n(d): This condition is characterized by a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right and normal spring test. It is consistent with the lumbosacral mobility freely.\nTherefore, the answer is (a), (c) or (d).\n\nQuestion Keywords: A, comes, to, a, 3-day, throat,, nonproductive, cough,, headache, is, worse, provide, some, shortness, of, breath., history, than, the, are, temperature,  (99.4\u00b0F),, pressure, 120/84, Examination, nares, mucous, Examination, throat, and, lymphoid, the, posterior, oropharynx., There, is, palpable, are, to,  auscultation., Which, the, the, cause, this, patient's, symptoms?\nCandidate Answers: (a) Allergic rhinitis (b) Epstein-Barr virus (c) Mycoplasma pneumonia (d) Rhinovirus\nContext: Sore throats and frontal headaches are common symptoms experienced in various upper respiratory viral infections.

No relationship can be found.\nTherefore, the answer is none.\n\nQuestion Keywords: healthy, physician, 8, after, killed, a, car, time,, a, decreased, appetite, and, She, states, is, been, rechecking, the, five, before, her, house, to, count, of, uses, She, she, has, a, perfectionist, but, these, urges, and, are, be, targeted, neurotransmitters?\nCandidate Answers: (a) Dopamine (b) Glutamate (c) Norepinephrine (d) Serotonin\nContext: Each of the answer choices corresponds to a specific neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals within the nervous system and between neurons.
