        "Answer Choice": "(a) anterior scalene (b) latissimus dorsi (c) pectoralis minor (d) quadratus lumborum",
        "context_v5": "Normal heart and lung findings on a physical exam coupled with evidence of exhalation dysfunction in ribs 4-5 on the right suggest a musculoskeletal cause of exertional chest pain.\n(a): The anterior scalene muscle attaches to the first rib, making it less likely to be the cause of dysfunction in ribs 4-5.\n(b): The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches to ribs 9 and 10, which is further down the ribcage than the affected area.\n(c): Pectoralis minor: The pectoralis minor muscle is attached to ribs 3, 4, and 5. Dysfunction in the fourth and fifth ribs can be caused by issues with the pectoralis minor muscle due to its attachment to these ribs.\n(d): Given that the quadratus lumborum muscle attaches to ribs 11 and 12, it is improbable that it is the cause of the exhalation dysfunction observed in ribs 4-5.\nTherefore, the answer is (c).",
