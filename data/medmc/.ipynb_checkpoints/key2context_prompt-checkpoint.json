        "Keywords": "Maximum, increase, prolactin level",
        "Answer Choices": "(a) Risperidone (b) Clozapine (c) Olanzapine (d) Aripiprazole",
        "Context": "The four drugs in answer choices are all atypical antipsychotics, which are used to treat psychotic conditions like schizophrenia through blockage of dopamine and serotonin receptors. These drugs block dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Maximum increase in prolactin, or hyperprolactinemia, is one of the side effects of atypical antipsychotics, because dopamine tends to inhibit prolactin release from the anterior pituitary.\n(a): Risperidone is a type of atypical antipsychotics that block dopamine D2 receptor and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor. It is generally used to treat schizophrenia or disorders with concomitant psychosis. Hyperprolactinemia is one of the most common side effects of risperidone.\n(b): Clozapine is used to treat schizophrenia or disorders with concomitant psychosis. Clozapine is associated with side effects such as agranulocytosis, seizures, and myocarditis, but it does not appear to elevate prolactin levels. It is not the drug to increase prolactin levels.\n(c): Olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia or disorders with concomitant psychosis. The side effect of olanzapine does not include hyperprolactinemia. It is not the drug to increase prolactin levels.\n(d): Aripiprazole is generally used to treat schizophrenia or disorders with concomitant psychosis. The side effect of olanzapine does not include hyperprolactinemia. It is not the drug to increase prolactin levels.\nTherefore, the answer is (a)."

        "Answer Choices": "(a) Anulus fibrosus (b) Nucleus pulposus (c) Posterior longitudinal ligament (d) Anterior longitudinal ligament",
        "Context": "The male is complained of a severe back pain and inability to move, and radiographic evidence shows the compression of a nerve component. This may suggest a herniated intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. The soft, gelatinous nucleus pulposus is forced out through a weakened part of the disk, compressing nerve components of the spinal cord and resulting in back pain and nerve root irritation. This impingement is resulting in paralysis, and should be considered a medical emergency.\n(a): Annulus fibrosus is a tough, circular exterior of the intervertebral disc, made up of fibrous connective tissue. It surrounds the soft inner core, the nucleus pulposus. It is not the component that is forced out by the tear.\n(b): Nucleus pulposus is the inner core of the vertebral disc. The tear in the annulus fibrosus causes it to be forced out, which results in compression of the nerve components of the vertebrae.\n(c): Posterior longitudinal ligament connects and stabilizes the bones of the spinal column. It runs almost the entire length of the spine, from the 2nd vertebra in the cervical spine (neck) all the way down to the sacrum (end of the spine). This ligament is located adjacent to the spinal cord. It is not easily teared or curved.\n(d): Anterior longitudinal ligament is a ligament that runs down the anterior surface of the spine. It traverses all of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs on their ventral side. It has a high tensile strength and is resistant to tearing or deformation. It is not easily teared or curved.\nTherefore, the answer is (b)."

        "Answer Choices": "(a) Dendritic cells (b) Type I pneumocytes (c) Type II pneumocytes (d) APUD cells",
        "Context": "Neuroendocrine cells are part of the neuroendocrine system. The neuroendocrine cells of the lung make hormones that control the flow of air and blood in the lungs.This may suggest a herniated intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. The soft, gelatinous nucleus pulposus is forced out through a weakened part of the disk, compressing nerve components of the spinal cord and resulting in back pain and nerve root irritation. This impingement is resulting in paralysis, and should be considered a medical emergency.\n(a): Dendritic cells are a type of antigen-presenting cell in the immune system that act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems. They are not a type of neuroendocrine cell.\n(b): Type I pneumocytes are alveolar cells that line the alveolar surface of the lungs and are responsible for gas exchange. They are not a type of neuroendocrine cell.\n(c): Type II pneumocytes are alveolar cells that secrete surfactant to reduce alveolar surface tension and prevent alveolar collapse. They are not a type of neuroendocrine cell.\nThis ligament is located adjacent to the spinal cord. It is not easily teared or curved.\n(d): APUD cells are a type of neuroendocrine cell that function through amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation.\nTherefore, the answer is (d)."

        "Answer Choices": "(d) Streptococci (b) Staphalococci (c) Clastridium pertringes (d) Vibrio",
        "Context": "Infections that can be spread through water contamination are generally transmitted orally or via fecal matter.\n(a): Streptococci are spread through direct contact with the nose and throat discharges of an infected individual or with infected skin lesions. Water is not a medium for the spread of streptococci. They are not bacteria that indicate the remote contamination of water.\n(b): Staphylococci is spread by skin contact, like a bite or cut. They do not indicate the remote contamination of water.\n(c): Clostridium perfringens are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. They are environmentally stable and specific to contamination by sewage, so their spread is a possible indicator of water contamination.\n(d): Vibrio species are gram-negative bacteria that spread through foodborne infection, but they are highly salt tolerant and unable to survive in fresh water. They may not indicate water contamination.\nTherefore, the answer is (c)."

        "Answer Choices": "(a) Painless condition (b) Affects cornea (c) Sudden loss of vision (d) Bilateral in majority of cases",
        "Context": "Mooren's ulcer is characterized by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown etiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in the episclera and conjunctiva. Patients often experience severe pain, photophobia, and tearing along with a red inflamed eye.\n(a): Mooren\u2019s ulcer is a painful ulceration of the eye. It is not the truth of Mooren's ulcer.\n(b): Mooren's ulcer is characterized by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown etiology. \n(c): The symptoms of Mooren's ulcer do not include sudden loss of vision. It is not the truth of Mooren's ulcer.\n(d): About one third of Mooren\u2019s ulcer cases present bilaterally. The proportion is less than half. It is not the majority of cases.\nTherefore, the answer is (b)."
