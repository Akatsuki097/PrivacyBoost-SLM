Warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant, is associated with a risk of warfarin embryopathy, which can cause fetal abnormalities. Therefore, it is generally recommended to avoid warfarin during pregnancy. Heparin, a different type of anticoagulant, is considered safe for use during pregnancy. However, the choice of anticoagulant and the timing of its use should be determined based on the individual patient's medical history and condition. In the first trimester, heparin is generally preferred over warfarin to avoid the risk of warfarin embryopathy. Acicoumarin is another anticoagulant that is not recommended during pregnancy. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is also considered safe for use during pregnancy and is often used as an alternative to warfarin.",
