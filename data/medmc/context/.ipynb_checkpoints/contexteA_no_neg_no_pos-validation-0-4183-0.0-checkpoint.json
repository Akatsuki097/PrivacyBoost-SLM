It can be caused by a non-disjunction event during meiosis, resulting in an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the offspring. It can also be caused by a translocation, where a part of chromosome 21 breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. If one parent is a balanced translocation carrier, there is a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies.\n\nIn this case, Kamlesh is a 2-year-old girl with Down's syndrome.

The patient's medications, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide, can also contribute to hyponatremia, but the patient's urinary sodium is not consistent with diuretic-induced hyponatremia.

The nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to the liver for processing and distribution to the rest of the body. The large intestine, also known as the colon, absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and forms feces for elimination. The stomach is responsible for the initial breakdown of food through the secretion of gastric juices and mechanical churning. It is not the primary site of nutrient absorption.",

In this case, the tidal volume is given as 500 mL, and the change in intrapleural pressure is given as 4 cm water during expiration and 9 cm water during inspiration. The change in transpulmonary pressure is therefore 5 cm water (9 cm water - 4 cm water). The change in lung volume is equal to the tidal volume, or 500 mL.

It states that the myosin heads of the thick filaments attach to the actin of the thin filaments and pull them towards the center of the sarcomere, shortening the muscle fiber. This process is triggered by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which bind to troponin C on the thin filaments, causing a conformational change that exposes the binding sites for the myosin heads. The myosin heads then bind to the actin, and the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi provides the energy for the myosin heads to pull the actin towards the center of the sarcomere. Once the actin is pulled, the myosin head detaches and reattaches to a new binding site, and the process repeats until the muscle fiber has contracted to its fullest extent.",
